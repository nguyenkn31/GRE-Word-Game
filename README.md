# Overview:
This program consists of two games: match-them-up and hang-man. I will mention below the rules of each game and how to add the words in the Excel file so that the program can read from below.

# Pre-requisite:
To run this game, you will need a few components as belows.
1. Python: Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download and install Python as normal. Proceed to install as normal. Please check on the "Add to PATH" option if it prompts you to do so. Tip: If you want to check whether you have successfully installed Python or not, type "CMD" in the search bar. When the Command Prompt opens up, type "Python". If it mentions Python along with the version, then you have successfully installed Python.
2. Python Packages: You will need a few packages to run the game, including pandas, termcolor, and emoji. Open Command Prompt, then type "pip install [package name]". For example, for pandas, type "pip install pandas". Please do not include the quotation marks.
3. Microsoft Visual Studio Code: Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win and the program will automatically download. Proceed to install as normal.
4. I am not sure if you need this, but I have had one or two friends who deemed it necessary. When you are in Microsoft Visual Studio Code, press Ctrl + Shift + X. Look on the left side, in the "Search Extensions in..." box, type "Python". It should return a few options, click on the option called "Python" and it is from Microsoft. Install that extension.

# How to Open the Program and Start the Game:
1. Click on Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
2. On the top left corner, you will see File | Edit | Selection | ... Click on "File".
3. Click on "Open Folder".
4. The program now asks you to direct it to the folder you want to store your code in. Please note that you must put the Excel file "BarronWordList.xlsx" in that same folder. When finished, click "Select Folder".
5. On the left pane, you should see the Python file called "WordGame.py" - click on it to open that file.
6. You should see the run button (the green triangle) on the top right corner - click on that.
7. The program should be now running! In the terminal below (the lower half of the Microsoft Visual Code), you should see it prompts you to input either 1 or 2 (1 corresponds to match-them-up and 2 corresponds to hang-man). If you indeed see this, then you have succeeded! I have provided a demo in my video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrS0TyLsRDA&t=1s).

# How to Add Words to the Excel file:
1. Open the Excel file "BarronWordList.xlsx".
2. You will see that there have been some words in there that I put as examples for you. Simply read from Barron's GRE Most Essential Words top-down, then fill in the word, its type, meaning, and example. The first three fields are taken from Barron's GRE Most Essential Words; however, you should create the examples yourself so you will find them more relevant for you, and hence, you will (hopefully) remember the word much longer.
